# Stationarity in Time Series
Whether you want to predict the temperature of the environment or estimate electricity consumption for the next few months, 
stationarity of time series models is necessary if you want the forecasting model to work well. 
Most of the time series models are non-stationary either it gives an upward or downward trend or seasonal effects. 

The main aim of this practice is to discuss the methods for checking the stationarity in time series data. 
We will do the experiments on the time series data to check this.
